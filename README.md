## Analyses

Follow the steps listed below to re-run the analysis on O2:

1.  Run `Rscript src/get-data-from-comutation-project.R` to get the data
    from the *KRAS* comutation analysis.
2.  Run `Rscript -e
    rmarkdown::render('src/sirt4-comutation-analysis.Rmd')`

## Conclusions

There were patterns of comutation between *SIRT4* and the key members of
the PI3K signaling pathway, particularly with *PIK3CA* and *PIK3CG*.

These genes were also identified as strong predictors of a *SIRT4*
mutation in a binomial model.
